## 1. Project Objective

In this project, we leverage machine learning to accurately predict the probability that a hotel guest will show up for their booked stay ('0'), or if a no-show will occur ('1').

These probability estimates can support hotel operations management decisions, including staffing, inventory planning, booking reminders, deposit policies, and overbooking limits. By identifying bookings with a higher risk of no-show, the hotel can make more informed decisions that support business objectives such as reducing operational inefficiencies, improving resource allocation and protecting revenue.

## 2. Workflow Stages

To achieve the project objective, a machine learning workflow consisting of the following stages was developed, starting with the dataset noshow.db:

`noshow.db -> data ingestion -> data cleaning and validation -> feature engineering -> train/test split -> ML experiment -> pipeline selection and calibration -> holdout evaluation and results`

## 4. Results Summary

### Final Pipeline

Multiple candidate pipelines were compared during the ML experiment stage. The best candidate pipeline was selected based on the highest mean cross-validated AUROC, then calibrated on the train set (80%) using isotonic regression.

| Components of final pipeline | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Preprocessor | `preprocessor_v1` |
| Model | `LGBMClassifier` |
| Hyperparameters | `learning_rate=0.05`, `min_child_samples=20`, `n_estimators=300`, `num_leaves=127`, `class_weight="balanced"` |
| Calibration | Isotonic regression |

See [`notebooks/final_results.ipynb`](notebooks/final_results.ipynb) for multiple candidate pipelines compared.

Note: a scikit-learn pipeline is composed of a preprocessor, which feeds engineered and preprocessed features to a machine learning model with specific hyperparameters to make a prediction.

### Final Results

The calibrated pipeline was evaluated on the test set (20%).

First, we plot the ROC curve to visualise the tradeoff between True Positive Rate and False Positive Rate across various classification thresholds. True Positive Rate measures the proportion of actual no-shows that were predicted as no-shows. A higher True Positive Rate means that more no-show instances will be identified in advance and receive intervention. False Positive Rate measures the proportion of actual shows that were incorrectly predicted as no-shows. A higher False Positive Rate means that more guests who would have shown up may receive unnecessary interventions.For example, at the classification threshold where 60% of all no-show instances are identified (True Positive Rate = 0.60), around 15% of show instances are incorrectly predicted as no-shows (False Positive Rate = 0.15). Overall, the pipeline achieves an AUROC of 0.81, indicating that no-show instances are assigned higher no-show probabilities than show instances around 81% of the time, allowing robust discrimination between the two.

Moreover, we plot the precision-recall curve to visualise the tradeoff between Precision and Recall across various classification thresholds. Precision measures the proportion of predicted no-shows which are actually no-shows. Higher precision means that a larger proportion of interventions will be targeted at actual no-shows. For example, at the classification threshold where 60% of all no-shows are identified (Recall = 0.60), around 71% of the predicted no-shows are actually no-shows (Precision = 0.71).

Lastly, we plot the calibration curve to assess whether the predicted no-show probabilities align with the actual observed no-show rates. This is important because well-calibrated probabilities enable reliable estimation of operational quantities such as expected no-shows, expected show-ups, under-occupancy risk, over-occupancy risk, and the potential value of targeted interventions such as reminders. These estimates can then inform hotel operations management decisions, including staffing, inventory management, booking reminders, deposit policies, and overbooking limits, supporting business objectives such as reducing operational inefficiencies, improving resource allocation and protecting revenue.

## 5. Run the Full Workflow

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weifengsiew/machine-learning-pipeline-hotel.git
cd machine-learning-pipeline-hotel
```

### Environment Setup

Use Python 3.12.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On macOS, install the OpenMP runtime required by LightGBM:

```bash
brew install libomp
```

### Run the Workflow

Run the complete workflow:

```bash
./run.sh
```

The workflow downloads `noshow.db`, then runs data ingestion, cleaning and validation, feature engineering, model training and selection, probability calibration, and holdout evaluation.

After it finishes:

- Open [`notebooks/final_results.ipynb`](notebooks/final_results.ipynb) for the evaluation report.
- Find the selected model, test metrics, and pipeline summary in `results/ml_experiments/`.
- Find experiment parameters, metrics, and artifacts in `results/mlruns/`.
- Find data validation results in `results/validation/`.

Run stages individually:

```bash
./scripts/stage1.sh
./scripts/stage2.sh
./scripts/stage3.sh
./scripts/stage4.sh
```

| Script | Runs |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/stage1.sh` | Download `noshow.db` |
| `scripts/stage2.sh` | `data ingestion -> data cleaning and validation` |
| `scripts/stage3.sh` | `feature engineering` |
| `scripts/stage4.sh` | `train/test split -> ML experiment -> pipeline selection and calibration -> holdout evaluation and results` |
| `scripts/all_stages.sh` | Runs stages 1-4 |

## 6. To Configure a New ML Experiment

To add a new candidate pipeline:

1. Add a new preprocessor builder in [`preprocessor_registry.py`](src/hotel_no_show_prediction/sklearn_pipeline_components/preprocessor_registry.py).
2. Add a new model in [`model_registry.py`](src/hotel_no_show_prediction/sklearn_pipeline_components/model_registry.py).
3. Add model hyperparameter search grids in [`conf/base/parameters/model_hyperparams/`](conf/base/parameters/model_hyperparams/).
4. Add the candidate name, preprocessor type, and model key in [`ml_experiment.yml`](conf/base/parameters/ml_experiment.yml).
